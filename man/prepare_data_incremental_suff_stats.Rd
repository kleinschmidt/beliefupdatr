  group, n_blocks)
}
\arguments{
\item{training}{Data frame with training data: 'cue', 'category', and
'subject'.}

\item{test}{Data frame with test data: 'cue', 'response', and 'subject'}

\item{cue}{(Quoted) name of columns in training and test which have the cue
values.}

\item{category}{(Quoted) name of column in training data with the correct
category labels.}

\item{response}{(Quoted) name of column in test data with responses}

\item{group}{(Quoted) name of column with group identifiers}

\item{n_blocks}{Number of blocks to divide data into.}
}
\value{
A list of data for 'conj_id_lapsing_sufficient_stats_fit.stan'.

\description{
Approximates true incremental updating by breaking data into blocks of equal
numbers of trials, and then using training data from previous n-0.5 blocks to
update beliefs for test data from block n.  Further, uses the _overall_
sufficient statistics in each group, just adjusting the number of _trials_ in
each block.  This is because (in the dataset this was originally developed
for), the trial order was different for each subject and so when fitting
aggregate data it makes sense to use the aggregate statistics.
}
\details{
For now, the total number of trials in training and test need to be equal.
